## Description

This application was developed to provide users with a platform for organizing their thoughts through note storage. It utilizes Express and JavaScript, employing a json file as a pseudo-database for data storage and retrieval. My challenge involved integrating the backend and frontend of the application using Express. Enabling users to save, retrieve, post, and delete data through the frontend UI. While building the application, I gained insight into the capabilities of Express and its potential for large-scale database interactions with APIs.

## Technologies

- JavaScript (Client-side web development)
- Node.js (A runtime environment and server-side web development platform for JavaScript)
- Inquirer (Node.js library)
- NPM (Node Package Manager for Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo by running the following command in your terminal: `git clone git@github.com`.

2. Open in VS Code. (or whatever program you use to view and or edit code)

3. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application.

4. To run the server, within the terminal, type the command npm start or node server.js.

5. Once the server is running, users can then access the front end of the application within the browser to observe full functional site.

## Usage

This application requires a server running in the background, which is powered by Express. To start the server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the application's directory.

2. Install all dependencies by running the command "npm i".

3. Start the server by typing "npm start" or "node index.js".

4. Once the server is running, access the application's front end directly from the command line by holding the command key and clicking on the link <http://localhost:3001>.

5. Users can then view existing notes from the database or create new notes.

6. Any newly created notes will be saved to the database and persisted.
